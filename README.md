# Simple SVD MATLAB program

A simple SVD algorithm for handwritten digit distance using test and training set

# How to Run:

Download both training and test set and then the MATLAB file. Run the file within MATLAB (make sure train and test sets are in same directory as the program file). Code commented through each step to walk users through parts that can be changed to obtain results for a different number (default number is 9).

This was a basic project I did after my interest in SVD was peaked after taking an applied computational science course. Enjoy and please let me know of any ways I could improve the program.
